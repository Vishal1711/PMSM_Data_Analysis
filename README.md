# PMSM_Data_Analysis

Time series graph visualization and data analysis of PMSM data. The data set comprises several sensor data collected from a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) deployed on a test bench. The PMSM represents a german OEM's prototype model. The LEA department at Paderborn University collected test bench measurements.

Electric Motor Temperature dataset can be found [here](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/appendix_raspi_cam/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wkirgsn/electric-motor-temperature)https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wkirgsn/electric-motor-temperature). 185 hrs recordings from a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM).

Million of datapoints visualize using Plotly and Dash components. Created web applications using these libraries for data visualization and analysis.
